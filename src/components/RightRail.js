                        This project involved building the company's website to showcase services and certifications, 
                        making the immigration process to Canada more user-friendly. Leading a team of five, including 
                        developers, a UI/UX designer, a QA tester, and a project manager, I established a robust coding 
                        infrastructure. We followed UI/UX design patterns from Figma to meet the company's requirements. 
                        Development primarily used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express JS, Node JS, and React JS), and I 
                        managed deployment with Heroku and GoDaddy while ensuring site security with SSL certificates. 
                        GIT was employed for version control to maintain code synchronization and team collaboration.
